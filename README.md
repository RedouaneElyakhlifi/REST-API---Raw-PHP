# REST-API---Raw-PHP
REST API without using frameworks such as Symfony or Laravel.

I also made a to get all authors from database to put in a select form as options to choose from.

And I made some frontend to navigate through the read_sameAuthor.php API request.

Rest of the API calls have been tested with Postman.
