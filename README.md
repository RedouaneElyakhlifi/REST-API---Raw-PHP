# REST-API---Raw-PHP
I will make full CRUD API system. No authentication YET.

REST API without using frameworks such as Symfony or Laravel.

I also made a controller to get all authors from database to put in a select form as options to choose from.

And I made some frontend to navigate through the read_sameAuthor.php API call.

Rest of the API calls have been tested with Postman.

At the moment we have Create, Read and Update.

Working on Delete.
