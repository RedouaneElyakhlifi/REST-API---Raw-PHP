# REST-API---Raw-PHP
I will make full CRUD API system. No authentication YET.

REST API without using frameworks such as Symfony or Laravel.

- API calls have been tested with Postman.

- CRUD for both Posts and Categories.

- General API call function.

- 2 controllers: read all posts and read all categories.

Upcoming is adding an authentication. (api key)
